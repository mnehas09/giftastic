# Giftastic

Using the GIPHY API I created a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of a certain topic. I used a call to the GIPHY API and used JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

The theme I chose was Sports Teams. If you type in any sports teams in the search field and click submit, the web page will populate with a gif pertaining to that team.
